# Adview_prediction
The project is to train various regression models and choose the best one to predict the number of advertisement views using Python.
YouTube advertisers pay Youtubers based on ad views and clicks for the goods and services being marketed. YouTube advertisers want to
estimate the ad view based on other metrics like comments, likes, etc.Therefore, the project is to train various models and choose the
best one to predict the number of ad views or so-called advertisements. The data or information based on different attributes is needed
to be analyzed, refined and cleaned before feeding in the algorithms to get better results.
