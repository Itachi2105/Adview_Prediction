# Adview_prediction
The project is to train various regression models and choose the best one to predict the number of advertisement views using Python.
YouTube advertisers pay Youtubers based on ad views and clicks for the goods and services being marketed. YouTube advertisers want to
estimate the ad view based on other metrics like comments, likes, etc.Therefore, the project is to train various models and choose the
best one to predict the number of ad views or so-called advertisements. The data or information based on different attributes is needed
to be analyzed, refined and cleaned before feeding in the algorithms to get better results. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The file train.csv contains metrics and other details of about 15000 youtube videos. The metrics include number of views, likes, dislikes, comments and apart from that published date, duration and category are also included. The train.csv file also contains the metric number of adviews which is our target variable for prediction. The data needs to be refined and cleaned before feeding in the algorithms for better results.<br/>

# Attribute Information
'vidid' : Unique Identification ID for each video<br/>
'adview' : The number of adviews for each video<br/>
'views' : The number of unique views for each video<br/>
'likes' : The number of likes for each video<br/>
'dislikes' : The number of likes for each video<br/>
'comment' : The number of unique comments for each video<br/>
'published' : The data of uploading the video<br/>
'duration' : The duration of the video (in min. and seconds)<br/>
'category' : Category niche of each of the video<br/>
<br/>

# Objective
To build a machine learning regression to predict youtube adview count based on other youtube metrics.
